# risse-ro.github.io
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! As I'm a year into my programming journey and a student, I'm just being a little silly with it.

 TODO List:
 - ~~Add Github icon + link on nav bar~~
 - ~~Finish cards for project display~~
 - ~~Once mobile view is complete, properly media query for other screen sizes~~
 - Replace emojis with SVGs
 - Fill out with pertinent information (about, projects, etc)
 - Make custom art for the about / other sections
 - More 'pizzazz'! Like panels that grow slightly when hovered over
 - Improve site accessibility, add backup font in case Google Fonts don't load, etc

 BONUS:
 - Add Javascript for a more responsive site
 - ~~Change nav bar links to a clickable hamburger menu when in mobile view~~
 - Add transition animation when hamburger menu is clicked
 - Add button at footer to return to top of the site
 - Add a "Dark" mode that is triggered with the click of a moon symbol (or something like that)
 - Add "Github" dev log/commit history, if possible
